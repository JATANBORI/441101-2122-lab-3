# Practice Lab 3 â€“ Making Decisions
The goal of this lab is to understand relational and logical operators that evaluate to boolean types, that can be used in conditional statements to control the flow of execution of code.

In this lab we will describe, create and debug programs that make different decisions depending on input provided by the user. In order to make a decision we need a datatype that indicates our code should take either one path, or another. That datatype is the Boolean datatype. You can declare a variable of the Boolean datatype as show below. A bool can be assigned a value of true, or a value of false.
